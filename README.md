# SVG icon sprite package for Angular 4+

This [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-svg-icon-sprite) in Angular package format provides both
a solution for generating SVG sprites and a component for including them.

## Installation

```
npm install ng-svg-icon-sprite --save
```

After installing the package you can import it into any application’s app.module.ts by simply including it in its
`@NgModule` imports array:

```javascript
import { SvgIconSpriteModule } from 'ng-svg-icon-sprite'; // <-- here

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    SvgIconSpriteModule // <-- here
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

## Usage

To use your SVGs as a sprite you need to:

1. Generate a SVG sprite using the provided script
2. Include the `svg-icon-sprite` component with the proper sprite path and SVG name

### Step 1: Generate the sprite

Each time you add an icon, you need to run a script that generates the sprite. You might want to add it to your package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "create-icon-sprite": "svg2sprite ./src/assets/icons ./src/assets/sprites/sprite.svg --stripAttrs fill --stripAttrs stroke"
}
```

The used library [for sprite generation svg2sprite](https://github.com/mrmlnc/svg2sprite-cli) is already included as a
dependency that can be executed right away:

```
npm run create-icon-sprite
```

__Note: the fill and stroke properties are removed from the icon so they can be styled via CSS__

The script will take all SVG icons from `src/app/assets/icons` and create a sprite SVG into
`src/app/assets/sprites` using the [svg symbols technique](https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/).

```
app
└── assets
    └── icons (icons source)
        └── icon-1.svg
        └── icon-2.svg
    └── sprites (sprite destination)
        └── sprite.svg
```

### Step 2: Use the component

Now you can include icons by using the `svg-icon-sprite` component directive:

```html
<!-- here including 'cart' SVG from the sprite -->

<svg-icon-sprite
  [src]="'assets/sprites/sprite.svg#cart'"
  [width]="'22px'"
  [classes]="'my-icon-class'"
></svg-icon-sprite>

<!-- or with a dynamic icon name -->

<svg-icon-sprite
  [src]="'assets/sprites/sprite.svg#' + iconName"
  [width]="'50%'"
></svg-icon-sprite>
```

## Options

- `src` - icon source name, the syntax is `path/file#icon` where `path` is relative to app folder, `file` is
the name of the sprite and `icon` is the filename of the svg icon.
- `width` *optional* - width of the svg in any length unit, i.e. `32px`, `50%`, `auto` etc., default is `100%`
- `height` *optional* - the height of the svg in any length unit, if undefined height will equal the width
- `classes` *optional* - class name for this icon, default is `icon`
- `viewBox` *optional* - define lengths and coordinates in order to scale to fit the total space available (to be used if the viewBox of the SVG is missing)
- `preserveAspectRatio` *optional* - manipulate the aspect ratio, only in combination with `viewBox` (see SVG standard for details)

## Styling

To change the sprite color add a CSS `color` property to the component invoking svg-icon-sprite. The SVG component uses
the `currentColor` value to [pass the ancestor's color](https://css-tricks.com/cascading-svg-fill-color) through to the SVG shapes:

```css
/* host component styles */
color: red;
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Assets folder

If you have another folder structure than above, you can pass both your input and output path using the npm script:

```
svg-symbols sourcefolder > destination/filename.svg
```

You can combine the `ng-svg-icon-sprite` module with any other sprite generation technology if you wish.

### Custom Styling

To access inner SVG properties like `fill` or `stroke`, you need to use Angular's `::ng-deep` (former `/deep/`) selector in
the host component and select the `use` tag inside the SVG:

```css
/* host component styles */
::ng-deep svg.icon use {
  fill: orange;
}
```

or to access SVG properties like height or width:

```css
/* host component styles */
::ng-deep svg.icon {
  height: 85px;
  width: 85px;
}
```

### Scaling and Sizing

If your SVG does not scale like expected (i.e. it is cropped or larger than desired) it might be lacking a `viewBox`.
You need to set the `viewBox` property manually to match the size of the exported shape. A combination of the correct
`viewBox` and width is required. Add the `viewBox` property and decrease/increase the last 2 values:

```html
<!-- i.e. lower '0 0 80 80' to '0 0 40 40' to scale up/down -->
<svg-icon-sprite
  [src]="'assets/sprites/sprite.svg#star'"
  [width]="'40px'"
  [viewBox]="'0 0 80 80'"
></svg-icon-sprite>
```

Still having trouble with scaling or sizing? Try to clean your SVG icons before processing them into sprites by
additionally using [svgo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svgo). If this doesn't help either
[read this article](https://css-tricks.com/scale-svg/) about SVG scaling.

### Combining with SVG images containing inline styles

If you wish to combine the icon pattern with SVGs that contain inline styles that should not be overridden by CSS, you will have to provide another sprite file that keeps the stroke and fill attributes:

```json
"scripts": {
  "create-image-sprite": "svg2sprite ./src/assets/svg-images ./src/assets/sprites/image-sprite.svg"
}
```

The generated sprite will preserve it's original styles, but will not be styleable via CSS.

## Browser Support (tested)
- Chrome (63)
- Firefox (57)
- Safari 11
- Edge
- IE 11 (with polyfill, see below)

Check the [demo](https://jannicz.github.io/ng-svg-icon-sprite/) if it meets your requirements before using it.

### Polyfill for IE11 (and comparable)

Older browsers do not support referencing to (external) SVG symbols. To make it work for IE11 and lower you can add
[svg4everybody](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody) to your `polyfills.ts` file:

```javascript
// Import and execute in polyfills.ts file
import * as svg4everybody from 'svg4everybody/dist/svg4everybody.js';
svg4everybody();
```

## Local development vs. npm package

For users that would like to clone/fork this repository: this repo contains all development files for the ng-icon-sprite
package while the [npm library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-svg-icon-sprite) only includes the generated TypeScript package
in Angular package format. The latter was generated using [ng-packagr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-packagr)
by running `ng-packagr -p ng-package.json`
